Color Induction Tests
=====================

This directory contains all tests for the provided code. The tests are
separated into _unit tests_ and _integration tests_; the former focusing on
individual functions, and the latter containing full executions of the
model with validation of output given specific input and configurations.

The performance of the unit tests prove to be much easier to interpret,
while the integration test are essential to validate the functionality of
the model. 

To run tests, ensure that the `tests/` directory and all it's
subdirectories are added to your path.
