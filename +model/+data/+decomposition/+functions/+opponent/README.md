# OPPONENT DECOMPOSITION FUNCTIONS

This decomposition method attempts to directly simulate single and double
opponent cells in the primary visual cortex by combining center & surround
receptive fields in the R, G, & B color channels. For single opponent
cells, the receptive fields are concentric circular gaussians. For double
opponent cells, they are spatially separated elongated gaussians.
